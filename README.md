#Coursera

Coursera is a front-end for mathematical and science courses offered at [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

## Notice

I do not claim ownership or right to distribute these courses. I only made this application solely to practice React framework. Please do not use this as an alternative to the platform provided by the MIT Open Courseware. _Coursera_ is a trademark of [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I do not claim any rights to use this trademark. I used it because I could not think of any better name for my application, at the time of its creation. However, I will rename this repository to something else (like \*coralaka or something stupid) if the concerned parties have any issues with me using this word.
